<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>

If you have any questions regarding data sensitivity and protection, please contact Daniel Rough at drough001@dundee.ac.uk

<h2>Required Permissions</h2>

Depending on the researcher\'s study design, the app may track your location. A researcher may wish to geotag your survey responses. This data will not be available to us (the developers) and will only be available to the researcher who has designed your study.

You will be required to register using your email address. This personally identifiable information is encrypted through Google\'s Firebase database, is accessible only to the researcher who has designed the study you sign up to, and is not available to us (the developers).

Depending on the researcher\'s study design, the app may also track your activity. This information is limited to determining whether you are stationary, walking, running, driving etc, and no more specific activity information will be collected. As before, this data will not be available to us (the developers) and will only be available to the researcher who has designed your study.

With the exception of the researcher who has designed the study you sign up to, no other third party, including us (the developers) have access to any personally identifiable information.

The application also uses RSA public/private key encryption so that all data is encrypted using the java.security and javax.crypto packages, before being sent through HTTP to an online database.

<h2>Withdrawal of consent and deletion of data</h2>

We as app developers have no access to any personally identifiable information. We have \'write-only\' access, meaning that we can delete your data but cannot read it. You have full rights to have your data removed. If you wish for data collected on you to be removed, please contact us using the contact details above and this will be done.</string>
